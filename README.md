# i9Dev

A filantropist website to help business owners to find web developers willing to create a web application for them, without expectations for remunaration. ONGs and social groups are welcomed to request projects too.

### Getting Started

To clone and run this application, you'll need Git, Node.js (which comes with npm) and MongoDB installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/romulo2franca/freelar/

# Go into the repository
$ cd freelar

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
You can download MongoDB here: https://www.mongodb.com/ 

### Running

You will need to run both the backend server and the front-end server. Use the following commands to do so:

```
cd api-server
npm test
```
The api-server will run on the port 5000, make sure this port is not being used in your OS. You will need to have your MongoDB service running before running the api-server. After, you can start the fron-end server.

```
cd app-react
npm react
```
